# CCA/PLS Toolkit

This is a __MATLAB__ toolkit to incorporate __Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)__, __Partial Least Squares (PLS)__ and their different variants to investigate __multivariate associations__ between multiple modalities of data, e.g., brain imaging and behaviour. These models find pairs of weights (one weight for each data modality) such that the linear combination of the brain and behavioural variables maximise correlation (CCA) or covariance (PLS).

The toolkit includes various options for CCA/PLS models (e.g., standard CCA, standard PLS, regularized CCA, sparse PLS) and analysis frameworks (e.g., statistical framework, machine learning framework). It can also perform __Principal Component Analysis (PCA)__ to reduce the dimensionality of the data before entering them into standard CCA analysis (__PCA-CCA__).

Although there are methods to estimate all weights (or __associative effects__) for most CCA/PLS models at once, the toolkit uses an interative solution to be able to optimize the hyperparameters of the model (i.e., number of principal components or regularization parameters) for each associative effect independently. In such iterative solution, the CCA/PLS model estimates one pair of weights (one weight for each data modality) at a time. These associative effects are then removed from the data (by a process called deflation) and the same process is repeated multiple times. The iterative solution also allows to estimate different PLS variants by choosing a specific deflation.

For a short theoretical introduction to the CCA/PLS models, analytic frameworks and deflation methods used in the toolkit, see the link to the online documentation below. For further reading, see:
