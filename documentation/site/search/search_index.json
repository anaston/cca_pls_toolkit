These models find pairs of weights (one weight for each data modality) such that the linear combination of the brain and behavioural variables maximise correlation (CCA) or covariance (PLS). The toolkit includes various options for CCA/PLS models (e.g., standard CCA, standard PLS, regularized CCA, sparse PLS) and analysis frameworks (e.g., statistical framework, machine learning framework). It can also perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data before entering them into standard CCA analysis ( PCA-CCA ). Although there are methods to estimate all weights (or associative effects ) for most CCA/PLS models at once, the toolkit uses an interative solution to be able to optimize the hyperparameters of the model (i.e., number of principal components or regularization parameters) for each associative effect independently. In such iterative solution, the CCA/PLS model estimates one pair of weights (one weight for each data modality) at a time. These associative effects are then removed from the data (by a process called deflation ) and the same process is repeated multiple times. The iterative solution also allows to estimate different PLS variants by choosing a specific deflation.

In short, the PALM toolbox allows to use restricted permutations based on the exchangeability block structure of the data (i.e., which examples are allowed to be exchanged or not). The exchangeability block structure is also used for stratified partitioning of the data (i.e., some examples are kept in the same data splits). For further information on exchangeability blocks, see the section Data or Winkler et al 2015 and the PALM toolbox . Overview As illustrated in the figure below, the analysis can be divided into eight operations. Here we describe these operations and the contents of the output files they create: Initialization : setting and saving the analysis configuration into cfg*.mat file including a cfg structure. For details on cfg , see the section Configuration for analysis . Data splitting : creating training and test sets of the data and saving outputs into outmat*.mat and inmat*.mat files. The outmat*.mat file includes: otrid : 2D logical array defining the training sets of the outer data splits (rows corresponding to examples and columns corresponding to the outer splits), oteid : 2D logical array defining the test sets of the outer data splits (rows corresponding to examples and columns corresponding to the outer splits). The inmat*.mat file includess: itrid : 3D logical array defining the training sets of the inner data splits (rows corresponding to examples, columns corresponding to the outer splits, and 3rd dimension corresponding to the inner splits), iteid : 3D logical array defining the test sets of the inner data splits (rows corresponding to examples, columns corresponding to the outer splits, and 3rd dimension corresponding to the inner splits). Preprocessing : imputing, z-scoring and deconfounding the data and saving outputs into preproc*.mat . There are separate preproc*.mat files for each data modality, outer and inner splits. For instance, preprocx_split_1_subsample_1*.mat saves resulst of the preprocessing for the first outer and inner split of the data modality \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) . Depending on the preprocessing strategy, this file can include up to three variables: mu : numeric array storing the mean values of the features, sigma : numeric array storing the standard deviations of the features, beta : 2D numeric array storing the regression coefficients from deconfounding (rows corresponding to confounds, columns corresponding to features). Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the data and saving outputs into *svd*.mat . There are separate *svd*.mat files for each data modality, training and test set of the outer and inner splits. For instance, tr_svdx_split_1_subsample_1*.mat saves the SVD results of the training set of the first outer and inner split of data modality \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) . The tr_svd*.mat files include: VX (or VY ): 2D numeric array storing the right singular vectors for data modality \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) ) (rows corresponding to examples, columns corresponding to singular vectors), RX (or RY ): 2D numeric array storing the principal components for data modality \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) ) (rows corresponding to examples, columns correponding to principal components), LX (or LY ): numeric array storing the squared singular values for data modality \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) ). The te_svd*.mat files include: RX (or RY ): 2D numeric array storing the test data transformed into principal component space for data modality \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) ) (rows corresponding to examples, columns corresponding to principal components). Grid search : hyperparameter optimization using a grid search and saving outputs into grid*.mat . Before cleaning up the intermediate files of the analysis (see cleanup_files ), there are separate grid*.mat files for each hyperparameter combination and outer split. For instance, grid_split_1_L1x_1_L1y_1*.mat saves the results of the first outer split for the hyperparameter combination \\(c_x=c_y=1\\) (for details, see here ). After cleaning up, all grid search results will be compiled into allgrid*.mat . This file includes all the metrics that are used for evaluating the CCA/PLS model in the inner splits (for details, see cfg.machine.metric here ), for instance: correl : 2D numeric array storing the out-of-sample correlations in the validations sets (rows corresponding to outers splits and hyperparameters, columns corresponding to inner splits), simwx : 3D numeric array storing the similarity of \\(\\mathbf{w}_x\\) between the traingin sets of the inner splits (rows corresponding to outers splits and hyperparameters, columns corresponding to inner splits, 3rd dimension corresponding to pairwise comparisons), simwy : 3D numeric array storing the similarity of \\(\\mathbf{w}_y\\) between the training sets of the inner splits (rows corresponding to outers splits and hyperparameters, columns corresponding to inner splits, 3rd dimension corresponding to pairwise comparisons). Training/testing : setting hyperparameters and saving these into param*.mat . This file includes: param : a structure array with each structure storing the best (or fixed) hyperparameter combination for a particular outer split. fitting models on optimization sets (i.e., outer split), assessing the model weights on holdout sets and saving outputs into model*.mat . This file includes the model weights, \\(\\mathbf{w}_x\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_y\\) and all the metrics that are used for evaluating the CCA/PLS model in the outer splits (for details, see cfg.machine.metric here ), for instance: wX and wY : 2D numeric arrays storing the models weights (rows corresponding to outer splits, columns corresponding to features), correl : numeric array storing the out-of-sample correlations in the holdout sets, simwx : 2D numeric array storing the similarity of \\(\\mathbf{w}_x\\) between the training sets of the outer splits (rows corresponding to outer splits, columns corresponding to pairwise comparisons), simwy : 2D numeric array storing the similarity of \\(\\mathbf{w}_y\\) between the training sets of the outer splits (rows corresponding to outer splits, columns corresponding to pairwise comparisons). Permutation test : permutation testing and saving outputs into perm*.mat . Before cleaning up the intermediate files of the analysis (see cleanup_files ), there are separate perm*.mat files for each permutation. For instance, perm_0001*.mat saves the results of the first permutation. After cleaning up, all permutation results will be compiled into perm*.mat . This file includes all the metrics that are used for evaluating the CCA/PLS model in the outer splits (for details, see cfg.machine.metric here ), for instance: correl : 2D numeric array storing the out-of-sample correlations (rows corresponding to outer splits, columns corresponding to permutations), simwx : 3D numeric array storing the similarity of \\(\\mathbf{w}_x\\) between the training sets of the outer splits (rows corresponding to outer splits, columns corresponding to permutations, 3rd dimension corresponding to pairwise comparisons), simwy : 3D numeric array storing the similarity of \\(\\mathbf{w}_y\\) between the training sets of the outer splits (rows corresponding to outer splits, columns corresponding to permutations, 3rd dimension corresponding to pairwise comparisons). In addition, permmat*.mat file includes: permid : cell array with each cell storing a 2D numeric array to define the indexes of the permuted examples for a particular outer split (rows corresponding to examples, columns corresponding to permutations). Saving results : evaluating significance of results and saving outputs into res*.mat as well as the summary of results into results_table.txt . The res*.mat file includes the res structure with the following fields obtained during the analysis: dir : paths to your project, analysis and main outputs, frwork : results oriented details of the framework, stat : detailed results of significance testing, env : details of the computation environment.

In PCA-RCCA and RCCA analysess, the column headings display the hyperparameter values (i.e., amount of L2-norm regularization or number of principal components). Deflation : deflation of the data and repeating steps 4-8. for each associative effect. This operation doesn't save any output files. Configuration for analysis All details of a CCA/PLS analysis are defined in a single configuration variable. This variable is a simple MATLAB structure called cfg , which includes the following main fields: dir : paths to your project, analysis and the outputs of preprocessing, machine : name and other details of the CCA/PLS model, e.g., hyperparameter settings, frwork : details of the framework, e.g., number of data splits, defl : name and details of the deflation method, stat : details of the statistical inference, e.g., number of permutations, data : details of the data e.g., dimensionality, env : details of the computation environment, e.g., local computer or cluster. Use the cfg_defaults function to initialize and update all necessary settings to your cfg . To get a more detailed description of the fields and subfields of cfg , please see here . Please find an example of how to set these variables below: Matlab % Project folder cfg . dir . project = '/PATH/TO/PROJECT/' ; % Machine settings cfg . machine . name = 'spls' ; cfg . machine . param . crit = 'correl+simwxy' ; % Framework settings cfg . frwork . name = 'holdout' ; cfg . frwork . split . nout = 1 ; % Deflation settings cfg . defl . name = 'pls-modeA' ; % Environment settings cfg . env . comp = 'local' ; % Statistical inference settings cfg . stat . nperm = 1000 ; % Update cfg with defaults cfg = cfg_defaults ( cfg ); Data The input data used in a CCA/PLS analysis must be stored in a dedicated folder called data within the project directory (see the demo folder of the toolkit as an example structure and the details on the Getting Started page here ). The \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) matrices should be stored in a specific format inside two .mat files: X.mat including a 2D numeric array called X , which stores one of the data modalities, Y.mat including a 2D numeric array called Y , which stores the other data modality. In both cases, rows correspond to examples (e.g., subjects in a group level analysis) and columns correspond to features (e.g., behavioural measures or brain measures of voxel-wise, connectivity or region-of-interest data). In addition, you can provide other input data matrices, which should be in a similar format: C.mat including a 2D numeric array called C , which stores the confounding variables of the analysis (rows corresponding to examples, columns corresponding to confounds), EB.mat including a 2D numeric array called EB , which defines the exchangeability block structure of the data (rows corresponding to examples, columns corresponding to the exchangeability blocks). The EB matrix can be used for stratified partitioning of the data and/or using restricted permutations. For instance, you can use this to provide the genetic dependencies of your data (e.g., twins, family structure) or different cohorts (e.g., healthy vs. depressed sample). For details on how to create the EB matrix, see Winkler et al 2015 and the PALM toolbox .","title":"Analysis"},{"location":"analysis/#overview","text":"As illustrated in the figure below, the analysis can be divided into eight operations.

In all models, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) represent matrices for the two data modalities, each matrix containing one standardized (i.e., having zero mean and unit variance) variable/feature per column and one example/sample per row. The model weights, \\(\\mathbf{w}_x\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_y\\) (one weight vector for each modality) are column vectors with the same number of elements as the number of variables in their corresponding data modality. Notations for L1 and L2-norm: \\(||\\mathbf{w}||_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} |x_k|^2}\\) is the L2-norm of a vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) , i.e., square root of the sum of squares of weight values, \\(||\\mathbf{w}||_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |x_k|\\) is the L1-norm of a vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) , i.e., sum of absolute weight values. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) CCA ( Hotelling 1936 ) finds a pair of weights, \\(\\mathbf{w}_x\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_y\\) , such that the correlation between the projections of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) onto these weights are maximised: $$ max_{\\mathbf{w}_x,\\mathbf{w}_y} \\text{ } corr(\\mathbf{Xw}_x,\\mathbf{Yw}_y) $$ Most commonly though, CCA is expressed in the form of a constrained optimization problem: $$ max_{\\mathbf{w}_x,\\mathbf{w}_y} \\text{ } \\mathbf{w}_x T\\mathbf{X} T\\mathbf{Yw}_y $$ $$ \\text{subject to } \\mathbf{w}_x T\\mathbf{X} T\\mathbf{Xw}_x = 1,\\ \\mathbf{w}_y T\\mathbf{Y} T\\mathbf{Yw}_y = 1 $$ We highlight that it is not possible to obtain a solution for this standard CCA when the number of variables exceeds the number of examples (technically speaking, the optimization problem is ill posed). Two approaches have been proposed to address this problem: reducing the dimensionality of the data with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)(e.g., Smith et al. 2015 , Helmer et al. 2020 , Alnaes et al. 2020 ), using regularized extensions of CCA and PLS (e.g., Xia et al. 2018 , Ing et al. 2019 , Popovic et al. 2020 ). We note that although PLS always has a solution (i.e., never ill posed) irrespective of the number of variables, it might still benefit from regularization. Adding an L1-norm regularization, for example, pushes the weights of some variables to zero and therefore forcing the model to learn a sparse solution. Partial Least Squares (PLS) PLS (Wold 1985, Wegelin 2000 ) finds a pair of weights, \\(\\mathbf{w}_x\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_y\\) , such that the covariance between the projections of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) onto these weights are maximised: $$ max_{\\mathbf{w}_x,\\mathbf{w}_y} \\text{ } cov(\\mathbf{Xw}_x,\\mathbf{Yw}_y) $$ Similar to CCA, PLS is most often expressed as a constrained optimization problem in the following form: $$ max_{\\mathbf{w}_x,\\mathbf{w}_y} \\text{ } \\mathbf{w}_x T\\mathbf{X} T\\mathbf{Yw}_y $$ $$ \\text{subject to } ||\\mathbf{w}_x||_2^2 = 1,\\ ||\\mathbf{w}_y||_2^2 = 1 $$ PLS is a family of methods. Depending on the modelling aim, PLS variants can be divided into two main groups: symmetric variants (PLS-mode A, PLS-SVD): with the aim of identifying associations between two data modalities, asymmetric variants (PLS1, PLS2): with the aim of predicting one modality from another modality. For details on these variants, see e.g., Wegelin 2000 , Rosipal & Kramer 2006 , Krishnan et al. 2011 , Mihalik et al. 2020 . All PLS variants use the same optimization problem but they differ in their deflation strategies . Therefore, whereas all variants yield the same first associative effect, the weights from the second associative effects will be different. CCA with PCA dimensionality reduction (PCA-CCA) PCA transforms each modality of multivariate data into uncorrelated principal components, such that the variance of each principal component is maximised: $$ max_{\\mathbf{w}_x} \\text{ } var(\\mathbf{Xw}_x) $$ \\[ max_{\\mathbf{w}_y} \\text{ } var(\\mathbf{Yw}_y) \\] These principal components (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{R}_x=\\mathbf{Xw}_x\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R}_y=\\mathbf{Yw}_y\\) ) are then entered into CCA resulting in the following constrained optimization problem: $$ max_{\\mathbf{v}_x,\\mathbf{v}_y} \\text{ } \\mathbf{v}_x T\\mathbf{R}_x T\\mathbf{R}_y\\mathbf{v}_y $$ $$ \\text{subject to } \\mathbf{v}_x T\\mathbf{R}_x T\\mathbf{R}_x\\mathbf{v}_x = 1, $$ $$ \\mathbf{v}_y T\\mathbf{R}_y T\\mathbf{R}_y\\mathbf{v}_y = 1 $$ PCA is often used as naive dimensionality reduction technique, as principal components explaining little variance are assumed to be noise and discarded, and the remaining principal components are entered into CCA. Regularized CCA (RCCA) In RCCA, L2-norm regularization is added to the CCA optimization ( Vinod 1976 ), which leads to the following constrained optimization problem: $$ max_{\\mathbf{w}_x,\\mathbf{w}_y} \\text{ } \\mathbf{w}_x T\\mathbf{X} T\\mathbf{Yw}_y $$ $$ \\text{subject to } (1-c_x)\\mathbf{w}_x T\\mathbf{X} T\\mathbf{Xw}_x+c_x||\\mathbf{w}_x||_2^2 = 1, $$ $$ (1-c_y)\\mathbf{w}_y T\\mathbf{Y} T\\mathbf{Yw}_y+c_y||\\mathbf{w}_y||_2^2 = 1 $$ The two hyperparameters of RCCA ( \\(c_x\\) , \\(c_y\\) ) control the amount of L2-norm regularization. We can see that these hyperparameters provide a smooth transition between CCA ( \\(c_x=c_y=0\\) , not regularized) and PLS ( \\(c_x=c_y=1\\) , most regularized), thus RCCA can be thought of as a mixture of CCA and PLS optimization. Sparse PLS (SPLS) In SPLS, L1-norm regularization is added to the PLS optimization (e.g., Le Cao et al. 2008 , Monteiro et al. 2016 ), which leads to the following constrained optimization problem: $$ max_{\\mathbf{w}_x,\\mathbf{w}_y} \\text{ } \\mathbf{w}_x T\\mathbf{X} T\\mathbf{Yw}_y $$ $$ \\text{subject to } ||\\mathbf{w}_x||_2^2 \\le 1,\\ ||\\mathbf{w}_x||_1 \\le c_x,\\ ||\\mathbf{w}_y||_2^2 \\le 1,\\ ||\\mathbf{w}_y||_1 \\le c_y\\ $$ The two hyperparameters of SPLS ( \\(c_x\\) , \\(c_y\\) ) control the amount of L1-norm regularization. These hyperparameters set an upper limit to the L1-norm of the weights, thus imposing sparsity on the weights (i.e., the weights of some variables will be set to 0). Similar to PLS, SPLS can also have different variants based on the deflation methods (e.g., generalized deflation in Monteiro et al. 2016 , PLS-mode A deflation in Le Cao et al. 2009 , PLS2 deflation in Le Cao et al. 2008 ). Analysis frameworks In order to optimize the hyperparameters (i.e., number of principal components or regularization parameters) and to perform statistical inference (i.e., assess the number of significant associative effects), the CCA/PLS model is embedded in an analytical framework. The figures below (adapted from Mihalik et al., under review) illustrate the two frameworks included in the toolkit. In the statistical framework , CCA/PLS is fitted on the entire data and the resulting model weights are used to compute in-sample correlation. There is no hyperparameter optimization, i.e., the number of principal components (PCA-CCA) or regularization parameters (RCCA, SPLS) is fixed. To assess the number of significant associative effects, we use permutation testing based on the in-sample correlation. In particular, we shuffle the order of the subjects (i.e., rows) in \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) and fit the CCA/PLS model to compute permuted in-sample correlations. Critically, we calculate the p-value as the fraction of permuted in-sample correlations exceeding the in-sample correlation obtained on the non-permuted data of the first associative effect (i.e., maximum statistics approach). In the machine learning framework , first we randomly split the data into optimization set (e.g., 80% of the overall data) and holdout set (e.g., 20% of the overall data). For CCA/PLS models with hyperparameters (i.e., PCA-CCA, RCCA and SPLS), we further split the optimization set multiple times into training set (e.g., 80% of the optimization set) and validation set (e.g., 20% of the optimization set). The inner split is used for hyperparameter optimization and the outer split is used for statistical inference. The best hyperparameters (one for each data modality) are selected based on the best generalizability of the model (measured as the average out-of-sample correlation in the validation sets). To assess the number of significant associative effects, we use permutation testing based on the out-of-sample correlation in the holdout set. In particular, we shuffle the order of the subjects (i.e., rows) in \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) and fit the CCA/PLS model to compute permuted out-sample correlation. We calculate the p-value as the fraction of permuted out-of-sample correlations exceeding the out-of-sample correlation obtained on the non-permuted data. If multiple holdout sets are used then the p-value for each holdout set is corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction (e.g., \\(\\alpha=0.05/10=0.005\\) in case of 10 holdout sets). This means that the associative effect is considered significant if \\(p \\le 0.005\\) in at least one of the holdout sets (omnibus hypothesis approach, for details see Monteiro et al. 2016 ). An important component of the CCA/PLS framework is testing the stability of the model . In the toolkit, the stability of the CCA/PLS model is measured as the average similarity of weights across different training (or optimization) sets (of course, at least two splits of data are needed for this). In addition to assessing the stability of the CCA/PLS model in the outer splits, stability can be also used as a joint criterion with generalizability for hyperparameter optimization (for details, see Mihalik et al. 2020 ). Deflation methods The toolkit includes three different deflation methods for CCA/PLS models: generalized deflation, PLS-mode A deflation, PLS regression deflation. CCA , RCCA and PLS-SVD can be all seen as subcases of the generalized eigenvalue problem. The iterative solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem uses generalized deflation, which thus will be the deflation strategy for these models. This deflation can be written as: \\[ \\mathbf{X}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{X}_{i} - \\mathbf{X}_{i} \\mathbf{w}_x \\mathbf{w}_x^T \\mathbf{B}_{x} \\] \\[ \\mathbf{Y}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{Y}_{i} - \\mathbf{Y}_{i} \\mathbf{w}_{y} \\mathbf{w}_y^T \\mathbf{B}_{y} \\] where we used the same notations as in the CCA/PLS models and \\(\\mathbf{B}_x,\\mathbf{B}_y\\) define the different subcases of the generalized eigenvalue problem. In case of RCCA, \\(\\mathbf{B}_x = (1-c_x)\\mathbf{X}_0^T\\mathbf{X}_0+c_x\\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_y = (1-c_y)\\mathbf{Y}_0^T\\mathbf{Y}_0+c_y\\mathbf{I}\\) , where \\(\\mathbf{X}_0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_0\\) are the original data matrices without deflation, \\(c_x\\) and \\(c_y\\) are the hyperparameters of L2-norm regularization in RCCA . CCA and PLS-SVD are specific cases of \\(c_x=c_y=0\\) and \\(c_x=c_y=1\\) , respectively. PLS-mode A uses the following deflation: \\[ \\mathbf{X}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{X}_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\mathbf{w}_x \\mathbf{p}^T \\] \\[ \\mathbf{Y}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{Y}_i - \\mathbf{Y}_i \\mathbf{w}_y \\mathbf{q}^T \\] where \\(\\mathbf{p}=\\frac{\\mathbf{X}_i^T\\mathbf{X}_i\\mathbf{w}_x}{\\mathbf{w}_x^T\\mathbf{X}_i^T\\mathbf{X}_i\\mathbf{w}_x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{q}=\\frac{\\mathbf{Y}_i^T\\mathbf{Y}_i\\mathbf{w}_y}{\\mathbf{w}_y^T\\mathbf{Y}_i^T\\mathbf{Y}_i\\mathbf{w}_y}\\) . PLS1 and PLS2 are regression methods (PLS1 refers to the variant with a single output variable and PLS2 refers to the variant with multiple output variables), in which case only the input data needs to be deflated as follows: $$ \\mathbf{X}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{X}_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\mathbf{w}_x \\mathbf{p}^T $$ where the same notations are used as above.

Computation time on a single machine is about 1-3 hours. For more details, please see the in-depth online or PDF documentation of the toolkit available at https://github.com/anaston/PLS_CCA_framework. Installation and prerequisites First, if you have Git already installed, clone the repository from Github using the following command in a terminal window under MacOS and Linux or in a power shell window under Microsoft Windows. Bash git clone https://github.com/anaston/PLS_CCA_framework In case you don\u2019t want to clone the repository via Git, you can also go to https://github.com/anaston/PLS_CCA_framework and download all scripts as a zip folder and unzip into a directory of your choice. After the toolkit is downloaded, open MATLAB and go to the folder containing the toolkit (e.g., double-click on the toolbox folder in MATLAB). To initialize the toolkit, run the following lines in the MATLAB command window: Matlab mkdir external set_path ; Dependencies For this demonstration, we need to add an additional MATLAB toolbox (PALM). For this, download PALM manually using this link (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM/UserGuide), copy the PALM folder into the external folder of the CCA/PLS toolkit, then finally add PALM to the MATLAB path using the following line in the MATLAB command window: Matlab set_path ( 'PALM' ); PALM is a toolbox that allows statistical inference using permutation testing whilst taking into account the dependencies in your data (e.g., family structure or diagnosis of subjects). Analysis setup In the following, we will run a Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS) analysis on low-dimensional simulated data. In general, the CCA/PLS toolkit uses a nested MATLAB structure to define all steps involved in a CCA/PLS analysis, which includes the exact algorithm, the type of deflation, the validation and statistical inference and so on. We call this configuration structure cfg and we will set its fields using the standard dot notation in MATLAB. For more information on all possible configurations, see the toolkit documentation. You can either follow this demo and copy and paste the relevant code sections into the MATLAB command window one at a time or you can simply run the demo_simul_paper.m script located in the demo folder of the toolkit. Project definition First, we specify the demo folder as our project directory in the cfg structure. Matlab % Project folder cfg . dir . project = fullfile ( '.' , 'demo' ); If you are working with your own data and from within a different folder, you need to change this variable to contain the path to your project. It is important that this folder you specify will also contain a 'data' folder where your data is located. Data The data used in this demo has already been created and saved to a folder under demo/data using the generate_data.m function with 1000 examples, 100 features in both data modalities (of which 10% include signal linking the two modalities) and noise level 2. The two modalities of data are stored in X.mat and Y.mat files. If you are using your own data, please make sure to create files that will match the simulated data structure, i.e., create X.mat and Y.mat files containing simple MATLAB arrays with rows for examples and columns for features. Machine For this demo, we will use an SPLS algorithm. All CCA/PLS models and their settings (e.g., amount or regularization) can be specified using the .machine field of the cfg structure. In this case, we will set the machine.name field to 'spls' to run SPLS. The metrics used to evaluate the CCA/PLS algorithms can be defined in the .machine.metric field of the cfg structure. Here, we specify in-sample correlation ('trcorrel'), out-of-sample correlation ('correl') measuring the generalizability of the model, similarity of the X and Y weights ('simwx', 'simwy') measuring the stability of the model across different training sets of data as well as the explained variance in the training set of X and Y ('trexvarx', 'trexvary'). To select the best hyperparameter (i.e., L1-norm regularization for SPLS), we will use generalizability (measured as average out-of-sample correlation on the validation sets) as optimization criterion. This is set by .machine.param.crit = correl . Finally, .machine.simw defines the type of similarity measure used to assess the stability of model weights across splits. We set this to 'correlation-Pearson' which will calculate Pearson correlation between each pair of weights. Matlab % Machine settings cfg . machine . name = 'spls' ; cfg . machine . metric = { 'trcorrel' 'correl' 'simwx' 'simwy' ... 'trexvarx' 'trexvary' }; cfg . machine . param . crit = 'correl' ; cfg . machine . simw = 'correlation-Pearson' ; Framework The .frwork field defines the general framework used in the analysis. We support two main approaches in the CCA/PLS toolkit. In a holdout machine learning framework, the data is divided into training and test sets by randomly subsampling subjects (see Monteiro et al. 2016 ). In a permutation statistical framework, the data is not splitted, focusing on in-sample statistical evaluation (see e.g., Smith et al. 2015 ). In this demo, we use the holdout framework with 10 inner and 10 outer data splits. For additional details, see the reference above, the accompanying tutorial paper or the online/pdf documentation of the toolkit. Matlab % Framework settings cfg . frwork . name = 'holdout' ; cfg . frwork . split . nout = 10 ; cfg . frwork . split . nin = 10 ; Deflation Next, we set the deflation of SPLS. In this demo, We will use PLS-mode A deflation. For more details on deflation strategies, see the accompanying tutorial paper or the online/pdf documentation of the toolkit. Matlab % Deflation settings cfg . defl . name = 'pls-modeA' ; Environment Next, we set the computational environment for the toolkit. As our data is relatively low-dimensional (i.e., number of features is not too high) SPLS will run quickly on a standard computer localy. For time-consuming analyses, this can be changed to a computer cluster environment. Matlab % Environment settings cfg . env . comp = 'local' ; Statistical inference In the last step, we define how the significance testing is performed. To reproduce the results reported in the accompanying tutorial paper, set this to 1000 permutations. If you need to save computation time, the number of permutations can be reduced. Please be aware, however, that too few permutation runs will make the precision of the calculated p-value low (e.g., 100 permutations allow to have a \\(\\textit{p}=0.01\\) at most). Matlab % Number of permutations cfg . stat . nperm = 1000 ; Run analysis To run the analysis, we simply update our cfg structure to add all necessary default values that we did not explicitly define and then run the main function. After the analysis, we clean up all the intermediate files that were saved during analysis to clean up disk space. This analysis will run for about 1-3 hours on a standard computer. Matlab % Update cfg with defaults cfg = cfg_defaults ( cfg ); % Run analysis main ( cfg ); % Clean up analysis files to save disc space cleanup_files ( cfg ); Results After running the analysis, you will notice that a framework folder has been automatically created by the toolkit inside the demo folder, containing all of the results. Inside the framework folder, another folder called spls_holdout10-0.20_subsamp10-0.20 has been created. This analysis folder should be unique to your analysis and by default it is named depending on the exact algorithm and analytic framework used. In this demo, it indicates that we have used an SPLS analysis with 10 holdout sets and 10 validation sets, each containing 20% of the data. As decribed in the accompanying tutorial paper, the associative effects identified by CCA/PLS are calculated iteratively, for instance, to be able to optimize the model\u2019s hyperparameters separately for each associative effect. These associative effects are called levels and the CCA/PLS toolkit will continue calculating additional associative effects whenever the current one reaches statistical significance. After running this demo, there are two folders under res in our analysis directory for level 1 and level 2. Since level 2 did not reach statistical significance, the toolkit stopped the computation at this associative effect. A quick overview of the results of level 1 can be found in the results_table.txt file located in the level 1 folder. In that file the correlation, associated p-value and, as this was an SPLS analysis, the number of selected features for the two data modalities are displayed for all specified splits (see Table below). split correl pval nfeatx nfeaty 1 0.4355 0.0010 12 9 2 0.3963 0.0010 12 12 3 0.3564 0.0010 33 58 4 0.3517 0.0010 29 4 5 0.4748 0.0010 11 10 6 0.4837 0.0010 9 10 7 0.3389 0.0010 11 15 8 0.3996 0.0010 12 57 9 0.3865 0.0010 10 13 10 0.4334 0.0010 10 11 All the additional results are stored automatically within corresponding .mat files. E.g., the results of the hyperparameter optimization are located in the grid folder separately for each level. Likewise, the results of the permutation testing are located in a folder called perm separately for each level. Loading the results To visualize the results of the SPLS analysis, a number of functions are provided in the toolkit to plot, e.g., the weights or latent variables of the individual associated effects. Before these functions can be called, they have to be added to the MATLAB path. To do so, run the following command in the MATLAB command window. Matlab % Set path for plotting set_path ( 'plot' ); Similar to the cfg structure that is used to define all analysis steps, a res structure can be created and used to load and visualize the results. First, we will load the results of the first level by specifying the directory of our analysis and the level we want to analyze. This is most easily done by quickly loading the cfg_1.mat file located in our results directory. The res_defaults function will then load the necessary result structure automatically. Matlab % Load res res . dir . frwork = cfg . dir . frwork ; res . frwork . level = 1 ; res = res_defaults ( res , 'load' ); Plot projections To plot the data projections (or latent variables) that has been learnt by the SPLS model, the plot_proj function can be used (see Figure @fig:proj). In this demo, we will add an x and y label to the res structure and will pass this as first argument to the plot_proj function. Next, we specify the data modalities as cell array and the level of associative effect. In this example, we plot the projections of X and Y for the first associative effect. We set the fourth input parameter to 'osplit' so that the training and test data of the outer split will be used for the plot which is paired with the fifth argument defining the specific outer split we want to use. We set this to the best data split (highest out-of-sample correlation in the holdout set). The next argument specifies the colour-coding of the data using the training and test data as groups. Then we specify the low-level function that will plot the results. In this case it is 2d_group which will call the plot_proj_2d_group function. All the other arguments of the plot_proj function are optional. In this demo, we flip the sign of the projection. Note, that that sign of the model weights or latent variables is arbitrary and can be changed for convenience (e.g., to compare results across models). Finally, we set the properties of the figure, axes and legends as Name-Value pairs. Matlab % Plot data projections plot_proj ( res , { 'X' 'Y' }, res . frwork . level , 'osplit' , ... res . frwork . split . best , 'training+test' , '2d_group' , ... 'gen.figure.Position' , [ 0 0 500 400 ], 'gen.figure.ext' , '.svg' , ... 'gen.axes.Position' , [ 0.1798 0.1560 0.7252 0.7690 ], ... 'gen.axes.FontSize' , 22 , 'gen.legend.fontsize' , 22 , ...

'proj.scatter.MarkerFaceColor' , [ 0.3 0.3 0.9 ; 0.9 0.3 0.3 ], ... 'proj.lsline' , 'on' , ... 'proj.xlabel' , 'Modality 1 latent variable' , ... 'proj.ylabel' , 'Modality 2 latent variable' ); Both the training and the test set show high correlations between the two latent variables, indicating that the learnt associative effect generalizes well. Plot weights Plotting model weights heavily depends on the kind of data that has been used in the analysis. In case of our simulated data, we are interested if the model recovered the weights that were used for generating the data (these true model weights were automatically saved in our data folder as wX.mat and wY.mat ). We will use a stem plot with the true and recovered weights in different colors (see Figure @fig:weights1 and @fig:weights2). The res structure will need to be passed as first argument. Next, we specify the data modalities and the type of the modality as strings. In this demo, we set these to X or Y and simul . The following argument defines the outer data split we want to use and will be set to the best split (as above for the data projections). Then we specify the low-level function that will plot the results. In this demo, it is set to stem to call the plot_weight_stem function and create a simple stem plot. Finally, we set the properties of the figure, axes and legends as Name-Value pairs. Matlab % Plot X weights as stem plot plot_weight ( res , 'X' , 'simul' , res . frwork . split . best , 'stem' , ... 'gen.figure.Position' , [ 0 0 500 400 ], ... 'gen.figure.ext' , '.svg' , ... 'gen.axes.Position' , [ 0.1798 0.1560 0.7252 0.7690 ], ... 'gen.axes.FontSize' , 22 , 'gen.legend.FontSize' , 22 , ... 'gen.axes.YLim' , [ - 1.1 1.2 ], ... 'gen.axes.YTick' , [ - 1 : 0.5 : 1.2 ], ... 'gen.legend.Location' , 'NorthEast' , ... 'simul.xlabel' , 'Modality 1 variables' , ... 'simul.ylabel' , 'Weight' , 'simul.weight.norm' , 'minmax' ); The same plot can be generated for the Y data modality. All plots are automatically saved inside the res/level1 folder. Matlab % Plot Y weights as stem plot plot_weight ( res , 'Y' , 'simul' , res . frwork . split . best , 'stem' , ... 'gen.figure.Position' , [ 0 0 500 400 ], ... 'gen.figure.ext' , '.svg' , ... 'gen.axes.Position' , [ 0.1798 0.1560 0.7252 0.7690 ], ... 'gen.axes.FontSize' , 22 , 'gen.legend.FontSize' , 22 , ... 'gen.axes.YLim' , [ - 1.1 1.2 ], ... 'gen.axes.YTick' , [ - 1 : 0.5 : 1.2 ], ... 'gen.legend.Location' , 'NorthEast' , ... 'simul.xlabel' , 'Modality 2 variables' , ... 'simul.ylabel' , 'Weight' , 'simul.weight.norm' , 'minmax' ); In this demo, we had only 1 significant associative effects. In case there are multiple significant associative effects, the process for plotting the results can be repeated for each level. Here, we plotted the results of the best data split, but other data splits can be also visualized in a similar manner.

We set this to the best data split (highest out-of-sample correlation in the holdout set). The next argument specifies the colour-coding of the data using the training and test data as groups. Then we specify the low-level function that will plot the results. In this case it is 2d_group which will call the plot_proj_2d_group function. All the other arguments of the plot_proj function are optional. In this demo, we flip the sign of the projection. Note, that that sign of the model weights or latent variables is arbitrary and can be changed for convenience (e.g., to compare results across models). Finally, we set the properties of the figure, axes and legends as Name-Value pairs.

In case of our simulated data, we are interested if the model recovered the weights that were used for generating the data (these true model weights were automatically saved in our data folder as wX.mat and wY.mat ). We will use a stem plot with the true and recovered weights in different colors (see Figure @fig:weights1 and @fig:weights2). The res structure will need to be passed as first argument. Next, we specify the data modalities and the type of the modality as strings. In this demo, we set these to X or Y and simul . The following argument defines the outer data split we want to use and will be set to the best split (as above for the data projections).

For more information on different algorithms, hyperparameter optimization, default parameters or additional plotting functions, see the CCA/PLS toolkit documentation.","title":"Plot weights"},{"location":"getting_started/","text":"Installation To install the CCA/PLS Toolkit, clone the repository from Github using the following command: Bash git clone https://github.com/anaston/PLS_CCA_framework After the toolkit is downloaded, go to the folder containing the toolkit and open MATLAB. In general, we advise you to run all commands from this toolkit folder. To initialize the toolkit, run the following line in the MATLAB command window: Matlab set_path ; Dependencies The neuroimaging community has great visualization and other tools, therefore we decided to use some of these available tools for specific purposes in the toolkit. Depending on the analysis and plots you would like to make you will need to download some of the toolboxes below. We recommend two ways of adding toolboxes to your path: you can just add the toolboxes to the path in their current location if you already have them on your computer, you can add the toolboxes in a dedicated folder (called external ) inside the toolkit. For easier management of the dependencies, all toolboxes are stored in a dedicated folder within the toolkit. To create this folder, run the following line in the MATLAB command window: Matlab mkdir external Importantly, this external folder (and its content) is not added to .gitignore and thus it is not version controlled by git. On the one side, this is to accomodate the specific needs of users and only to use toolboxes that are essential for their specific analyses and plots. On the other side, this is to avoid that the toolkit gets unnecessarily large due to potentially large external toolboxes. Here is a complete list of toolboxes that you might need for using the toolkit: PALM ( Permutation Analysis of Linear Models , used for permutation testing) SPM ( Statistical Parametric Mapping , used for opening files and reading/writing .nii files) BrainNet Viewer (used for brain data visualization) AAL ( Automated Anatomical Labelling , used for region-of-interest (ROI) analyses) To know which dependencies you will need for your specific analysis, please see the Analysis and Visualization pages. Below, an example is provided to illustrate how to add toolboxes to the toolkit using PALM. For this, download PALM manually by the provided link, copy the PALM folder into your external folder, then finally add PALM to the MATLAB path using the following line in the MATLAB command window: Matlab set_path ( 'PALM' ); Toolbox overview The toolkit consists of two main parts: Analysis Visualization The reason behind this division is that whereas an analysis can be run on a cluster without a need for a graphical output, the visualization usually takes place on a local computer with a need for a graphical output. Of course, if both the analysis and visualization are done on a local computer, the two can be easily combined as demonstrated in the examples. Analysis The figure below illustrates the inputs and outputs of each analysis. The main inputs of the analysis are: cfg structure, which is a MATLAB variable created by the user for the configuration of all the analysis settings, X.mat and Y.mat files including the two modalities of input data (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) matrices). Other input files can be also provided, for instance, C.mat file including the confounding variables of the analysis and \u00c8B.mat file including the (exchangeability) block structure of the data. For details on the cfg structure and the input data files, see Analysis . The main outputs of the analysis are: results_table.txt including the summary of the results, various .mat files including, for instance, information about the data splits, the results of hyperparameter optimization and the trained models (for details, see below). Next, we discuss the folder structure of your analysis and list the specific folders where the main input and output files are stored. As illustrated in the figure above, a project consists of a project folder with two subfolders: a data folder including the input data files, a framework folder including the results of the analyses with each analysis in a specific framework folder. We need to create the project and data folders manually and place our input data files within the data folder (illustrated by a red box in the figure). To generate simulated data, see the generate_data function. All the other folders and output files will be created by the toolkit during analysis. Our specific framework folder will be generated by the toolkit based on your CCA/PLS model and framework choice. For instance, an SPLS analysis with a single holdout set (20% of the data) and 10 validation sets (20% of the optimization set) will generate the spls_holdout1-0.20_subsamp10-0.20 folder. If you want to specify a custom name for this analysis, you can change cfg.frwork.flag from its default empty value, which will then append a flag to your specific framwork name. For instance, cfg.frwork.flag = '_TEST' will create the spls_holdout1-0.20_subsamp10-0.20_TEST folder. Each analysis will contain the following output files in the specific framework folder: cfg*.mat file including the cfg structure you created and filled up with other necessary default by cfg_defaults , outmat*.mat file including the training and test indexes of the outer splits of the data (i.e., optimization and holdout sets), inmat*.mat file including the training and test indexes of the inner splits of the data (i.e., inner training and validation sets). The other output files are stored in specific folders with each folder having one or multiple levels of results, where each level stands for an associative effect (e.g., first associative effect in folder level1 , second associative effect in folder level2 ): grid folder including the results of the hyperparameter optimization in grid*.mat files, load folder with a preproc folder including the preprocessed (e.g., z-scored) data in preproc*.mat files and an svd folder including the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the preprocessed data in *svd*.mat files (SVD is needed for the computational efficiency of the toolkit), perm folder including the results of the permutation testing in perm*.mat files, res folder including the best (or fixed) hyperparameters in param*.mat file, the results of the main trained models in model*.mat file, additional results in res*.mat file and the summary of the results in results_table.txt file. For additional details on the output data files, see Analysis . Visualization The figure below illustrates the inputs and outputs of visualizing the results. The main inputs of the visualization are: res structure, which is a MATLAB variable loaded from res*.mat and appended with settings for visualization, .mat files either as outputs of the analysis or other files including data (e.g., mask.mat including a mask for connectivity data) or other settings for visualization (e.g., options.mat including BrainNet Viewer settings), .csv files, which are label files including information about the variables in your \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) matrices, .nv file, which is a surface mesh file in BrainNet Viewer used as a template to overlay your brain weights on, .nii files, which can be an atlas file defining regions of interest (ROI) in the brain or a mask file for voxel-wise structural MRI data. The main outputs of the visualization are: images of figures, in any requested standard file format, e.g., .fig , .png , .svg , .csv files including information about the plotted results (e.g., ordered model weights). For additional details on the res structure and the other input and output data files of visualization, see Visualization . Info We also highly recommend that you go through the defaults of cfg and res so that you understand thoroughly the analysis and visualization settings. You can find a detailed documentation of each high-level function of the toolkit under the main menu Functions, for instance, see cfg_defaults . Finally, if you want to get started and run an experiment on your local computer, see Demo for a complete analysis and visualization. In addition, we provide three simple examples to generate and analyse simulated data , simulated structural MRI data , and simulated fMRI data . Next, we briefly discuss how to run an analysis on a cluster. Running on a cluster The toolkit can be run in multiple MATLAB instances, e.g., in a cluster environment. If you use SGE or SLURM scheduling systems, you simply need to send the same analysis to different nodes and the toolkit will take care of the rest. If you use a different scheduling system then a one-line modification of the cfg_defaults function is needed to account for your scheduling system and you are ready to go. Feel free to get in touch with us to help you set this up. Here is a brief description of what happens under the hood when the toolkit is running on different MATLAB instances. Although MATLAB can load the same .mat file from different MATLAB instances, it cannot save to the same .mat file . To work around this, the toolkit appends the unique ID of the computing node/job at the end of each .mat file (in a local environment, the ID is set to _1 by default), so even if different jobs are saving the same content simultaneously, they will do it into different files. In addition, there are a handful of wrapper functions to save, search and load these .mat files and the following mechanisms are in place to share computational cost: jobs save computations to .mat files regularly on disc, there is a random seed before each time consuming operation in the toolkit (e.g., grid search and permutation testing), hence different jobs will most likely perform different computations, jobs can load .mat files computed by other jobs, jobs regularly check what .mat files are available and they only start a new computation if that has not yet been performed by another job, if two MATLAB instances are saving the same computation to a .mat file then they will write to different files due to their different job ID-s. You might ask: doesn't this computational strategy create a lot of intermediate and some duplicate files? Indeed, that is the case, however, there is a cleanup_files function that allows to remove all the intermediate and duplicate files after your analysis is done. Do not forget to use this as otherwise you might exceed your disc space or have difficulties to move your results around, e.g., from a cluster to a local computer. An extra benefit of this computational strategy is that in case your analysis is aborted (e.g., you run out of allocated time on a cluster), you can always restart the same analysis and it will catch up with the computations where it was aborted.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#installation","text":"To install the CCA/PLS Toolkit, clone the repository from Github using the following command: Bash git clone https://github.com/anaston/PLS_CCA_framework After the toolkit is downloaded, go to the folder containing the toolkit and open MATLAB.

In general, if you want to use an interactive file selection, (i.e., pop-up dialog box to choose input files when needed), you need SPM . You also need SPM if you work with a mask or an atlas. For details on these, please see below. If you want to plot brain weights on a glass brain, you need BrainNet Viewer . We use BrainNet Viewer in the toolkit for plotting structural MRI weights either at the voxel or ROI level as well as fMRI connectivity weights either at the edge level or summarized by nodes. We suggest that you manually edit your preferred settings in the BrainNet Viewer GUI at first usage and save these options as otions.mat then the toolkit will be able to automatically set your configurations for the BrainNet figure in successsive plots. Overview There are three high-level functions to visualize your results: plot_proj : it plots the projections (or latent variables) of the data for an associative effect in a simple plot or for multiple associative effects in a multi-level plot . It can plot training and/or test sets of specific data splits. You can colour-code the subjects in the figure by groups or a continuous variable. plot_weight : it plots the model weights in specific formats. You can plot behavioural weights using text, vertical or horizontal bar plots. The brain weights can be plotted on a glass brain using BrainNet Viewer either as a map for voxel-level weights, as nodes for region-level weights and summarized connectivity weights or as edges for connectivity weights. You can also summarize connectivity weights as within and between-module connectivities. plot_paropt : it plots the grid search results of the hyperparameter optimization and it is a useful tool for diagnostics. It can visualize each metric in cfg.machine.metric as a function of hyperparameters irrespectively whether the requested metric was used as criterion for hyperparameter selection or not. Each metric is plotted in a separate subplot. These high-level functions will call low-level functions for a specific variation of a plot. A full list of high- and low-level plotting functions is illustrated in the following figure. The low-level functions are specified by the func argument of the high-level functions. For instance: to use the plot_proj_2d_group function, you need to call plot_proj with a 2d_group argument, to use the plot_weight_behav_horz function, you need to call plot_weight with a behav_horz argument. Matlab % Plot projections plot_proj ( ... , '2d_group') % Plot weights plot_weight ( ... , 'behav_horz') For a more detailed description of the high- and low-level functions, see the sections below. Configuration for plotting The main input of the visualization is the res structure including all the settings for your visualization. You might remember that res was initialized during your analysis and saved into res*.mat (for details, see Analysis ). First, we need to load the res structure either manually or using the res_defaults function as shown below. In the latter case, you need to initialize res with res.dir.frwork and res.frwork.level to inform res_defaults which res*.mat file to load. Matlab % Load res res . dir . frwork = 'PATH/TO/YOUR/SPECIFIC/FRAMEWORK' ; res . frwork . level = 1 ; res = res_defaults ( res , 'load' ); Once loaded, res can be populated with the following fields for the visualization of the results: gen : general options (e.g., interactive file selection) and settings (e.g., position, font size) for the figure, axes and legend, param : options for plotting the results of hyperparameter optimization, proj : options for plotting the projections of the data, behav : options for plotting the behavioural weights, conn : options for plotting the fMRI connectivity weights, vbm : options for plotting the voxel-level structural MRI weights, roi : options for plotting the region-level structural MRI weights, simul : options for plotting the weights of simulated data, brainnet : options for using BrainNet Viewer . Info Note that the fields for visualization are only temporarily added to res and not saved in the res*.mat file. To get a more detailed description of the fields and subfields of res , please see here . Projections One of the first results of your analysis that you will probably want to visualize is the projections of the data (i.e., latent variables) that are learnt by the CCA/PLS model. This plot can be created by the plot_proj function, which has the following required inputs: the res structure, the data modalities and the level of the associative effect, the type (outer and/or inner) and index of the data split, label for colour-coding the plot, and finally, the low-level function to use ('2d', '2d_group' or '2d_cmap'). The most simple projection plot can be created using the low-level function plot_proj_2d , which does not require any additional input files. Matlab % Plot data projections plot_proj ( res , { 'X' 'Y' }, res . frwork . level , 'osplit' , 1 , 'none' , '2d' ); The two other low-level functions allow you to colour-code your scatter plot by a continuous variable ( plot_proj_2d_cmap ) or groups ( plot_proj_2d_group ). There are different ways to define the colour-code: providing a group.mat file in your data folder, which should include a numeric array to define the colour map or groups, using the outer training and test sets to define the groups, providing a data and label file, where the data file should include the variable(s) and the label file should include the name of the variables to define the colour map or groups (by default, Y.mat and LabelsY.csv are used for these purposes but custom data and label files are also possible). In this example, we use plot_proj_2d_group to create a more advanced plot of the same data by also defining additional figure, axes and legend settings. Matlab % Plot data projections plot_proj ( res , { 'X' 'Y' }, res . frwork . level , 'osplit' , 1 , ... 'training+test' , '2d_group' , 'gen.axes.FontSize' , 20 , ... 'gen.legend.FontSize' , 20 , 'gen.legend.Location' , 'NorthWest' , ... 'proj.scatter.SizeData' , 120 , 'proj.scatter.MarkerEdgeColor' , 'k' , ... 'proj.scatter.MarkerFaceColor' , [ 0.3 0.3 0.9 ; 0.9 0.3 0.3 ], ... 'proj.xlabel' , 'Modality 1 latent variable' , ... 'proj.ylabel' , 'Modality 2 latent variable' , ... 'gen.axes.XTick' , [ - 5 : 2 : 5 ], 'proj.lsline' , 'on' ); Weights Another important part of the analysis results are the model weights of the learnt associative effect. The visualization of the weights are data modality dependent. For instance, the behavioral weights usually have only a few dimensions and can be best captured using a vertical or horizontal bar plot. The brain weights can be higher dimensional and their visualization might change depending on whether they belong to voxel-wise or region-of-interest structural MRI data, or fMRI connectivity data. Modality independent A data modality independent visualization can be achieved using a stem plot ( plot_weight_stem ). It does not require an input file by default. However, if you use simulated data and the true model weights are available as .mat files, you can overlay them on your stem plot. Matlab % Plot Y weights as stem plot plot_weight ( res , 'Y' , 'simul' , res . frwork . split . best , 'stem' , ... 'gen.axes.YLim' , [ - 0.2 1.2 ], 'simul.weight.norm' , 'minmax' , ... 'gen.axes.FontSize' , 20 , 'gen.legend.FontSize' , 20 ); Behaviour The behavioural weights can be best plotted using a bar graph, either vertically ( plot_weight_behav_vert ) or horizontally ( plot_weight_behav_horz ). Usually, only the top weights are plotted (e.g., the top 20 variables) and they are ordered by their actual weight values. Sometimes it might also be good to color in different behavioural domains such as cognition, emotion, clinical symptoms, psychometrics, or simply different questionnaires. Alternatively, the behavioural weights can be plotted as texts using plot_weight_behav_text . In this case, the weights themselves are actually not visualized (except of the minimum and maximum values), but the labels of the corresponding variables are displayed as text, separately for the positive and negative weights. This visualization makes sense if the labels are ordered based on the weights. To create these plots, a label file (usually a .csv file but can be any delimited file) is required with the following column headings: Label : describing the name or label of the variables, Category (optional): describing the different domains/categories the variables belong to. An example table is shown below. Label Category '1' 'Domain 1' '2' 'Domain 2' '3' 'Domain 1' Matlab % Plot behavioural weights as vertical bar plot plot_weight ( res , 'Y' , 'behav' , res . frwork . split . best , 'behav_vert' , ... 'gen.axes.FontSize' , 20 , 'gen.legend.FontSize' , 20 , ... 'gen.axes.YLim' , [ - 0.4 1.2 ], 'gen.weight.flip' , 1 , ... 'behav.weight.sorttype' , 'sign' , 'behav.weight.numtop' , 20 , ... 'behav.weight.norm' , 'minmax' ); Brain Plotting brain weights is probably the most complex as the dimensionality and type of data can be quite different across data modalities (e.g., voxel-wise, region-based, connectivity). These plots also need the most additional inputs. Voxel-wise sMRI Vowel-wise structural MRI weights are plotted on a cortical surface of a glass brain using BrainNet Viewer and the plot_weight_brain_cortex function. As the brain data is stored in concatenated form in the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) matrix, this function requires a mask file to be able to reshape the brain weights into the same format as the original structural MRI data came from. The mask file should be a 3D image in .nii format including booleans that define which voxels are used as features in your \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) data (e.g., grey matter in the cortex). By default, the brain weights will be overlaid on an MNI template provided by BrainNet Viewer ( BrainMesh_ICBM152.nv ) but you can also use our own mesh file if you like. In case your brain data is not in MNI space, you can use the built-in normalization option in the toolkit, which uses the reorientation, spatial preprocessing and normalize modules of SPM . For this, you will need to make sure that your brain data are in relative proximity to MNI space and you need to provide a source image which will be used as a basis for normalization. ROI-wise sMRI ROI-wise structural MRI weights are plotted on the cortical surface as nodes on a glass brain using BrainNet Viewer and the plot_weight_brain_node function.

It can plot training and/or test sets of specific data splits. You can colour-code the subjects in the figure by groups or a continuous variable. plot_weight : it plots the model weights in specific formats. You can plot behavioural weights using text, vertical or horizontal bar plots. The brain weights can be plotted on a glass brain using BrainNet Viewer either as a map for voxel-level weights, as nodes for region-level weights and summarized connectivity weights or as edges for connectivity weights. You can also summarize connectivity weights as within and between-module connectivities. plot_paropt : it plots the grid search results of the hyperparameter optimization and it is a useful tool for diagnostics. It can visualize each metric in cfg.machine.metric as a function of hyperparameters irrespectively whether the requested metric was used as criterion for hyperparameter selection or not. Each metric is plotted in a separate subplot. These high-level functions will call low-level functions for a specific variation of a plot. A full list of high- and low-level plotting functions is illustrated in the following figure. The low-level functions are specified by the func argument of the high-level functions. For instance: to use the plot_proj_2d_group function, you need to call plot_proj with a 2d_group argument, to use the plot_weight_behav_horz function, you need to call plot_weight with a behav_horz argument.

We set the signal to be sparse with 10% of the features in each modality that are relevant to capture the association across modalities. The noise parameter of the model is set to 1.

Although we recommend to use a multi-modal or functional atlas for fMRI connectivity data, for simplicity, we will use the AAL atlas to create a subset of 100 connections of the full connectivity matrix between all AAL regions.

We start by running set_path to add the necessary paths of the toolkit to your MATLAB path. Matlab %----- Analysis % Set path for analysis set_path ; Project folder Next, we specify the folder to our project. Make sure to specify the correct path. We recommend to use a full path, but a relative path should also work. Matlab % Project folder cfg . dir . project = fullfile ( fileparts ( data_dir )); Machine Now, we configure the CCA/PLS model we would like to use. We set machine.name to cca and machine.param.name to {'PCAx' 'PCAy'} for PCA-CCA . For quicker results, we fix the number of principal components. However, in general we recommend to determine the optimal number of components based on a grid search similar to demo_smri . Matlab % Machine settings cfg . machine . name = 'cca' ; cfg . machine . param . name = { 'PCAx' 'PCAy' }; cfg . machine . param . PCAx = 95 ; cfg . machine . param . PCAy = 95 ; For more information on the CCA/PLS models and the hyperparameter choices, see here . For further details on the choices of data settings, see here . Framework Next, we set the framework name to holdout and the number of outer data splits to 5 to perform a multiple holdout approach. Matlab % Framework settings cfg . frwork . name = 'holdout' ; cfg . frwork . split . nout = 5 ; For further details on the framework choices, see here . Environment Next, we set the computational environment for the toolkit. As our PCA-CCA implementation is computationally efficient, most of the times we can run it locally on our computer. Matlab % Environment settings cfg . env . comp = 'local' ; For further details on the environmental settings, see here . Statistical inference Finally, we need to define how the statistical inference is performed. As we use a multiple holdout approach, we have additional options here too. We will perform statistical inference in two steps. First, for each outer split we do permutation testing based on out-of-sample correlation. Second, to infer if the associative effect is significant across splits, omnibus hypothesis is used, which tests if any outer split is significant after adjusting the threshold with Bonferroni correction (e.g., p=0.01 in case of 5 splits). This approach is based on Monteiro et al. 2016 For quicker results, we wet the number of permutations to 100, however, we recommend using at least 1000 permutations in general. Matlab % Statistical inference settings cfg . stat . nperm = 100 ; For further details on the statistical inference, see here . Run Analysis To run the analysis, we simply update our cfg structure to add all necessary default values that we did not explicitly define and then run the main function. After the analysis, we clean up all the duplicate and intermediate files to save disc space. Note that if you run the analysis in a cluster environment then you will need to comment out the last line and run it manually once the analysis is completed as the cleanup_files function does not work in a parallel environment. Matlab % Update cfg with defaults cfg = cfg_defaults ( cfg ); % Run analysis main ( cfg ); % Clean up analysis files to save disc space cleanup_files ( cfg ); Visualization Now that we have run our first analysis, let's plot some of the results. Before we can do any plotting, we need to make sure that we have called set_path('plot') to add the plotting folder. Then we load the res structure. In general, we advise you to plot your results on a local computer as it is often cumbersome and slow in a cluster environment. If you move your results from a cluster to a local computer, you need update the paths in your cfg*.mat and res*.mat files using update_dir . This should be called once the res structure is loaded either manually or by res_defaults . Matlab %----- Visualization % Set path for plotting and the BrainNet Viewer toolbox set_path ( 'plot' , 'brainnet' ); % Load res res . dir . frwork = cfg . dir . frwork ; res . frwork . level = 1 ; res . gen . selectfile = 'none' ; res . gen . weight . flip = 1 ; res = res_defaults ( res , 'load' ); Plot projections To plot the data projections (or latent variables) that has been learnt by the model, simply run plot_proj . As first argument, we need to pass the res structure. Then, we specify the data modalities as cell array and the level of associative effect. In this example, we plot the projections of X and Y for the first associative effect. We set the fourth input parameter to 'osplit' so that the training and test data of the outer split will be used for the plot. The following argument defines the outer data split we want to use (in this demo, we have only one split). We use the second to last argument to specify the colour-coding of the data using the training and test data as groups ( teid ). Finally, we specify the low-level function that will plot the results.

We will discuss step by step how to generate data, run an analysis as well as how to visualize the results. Copy and paste the code chunks into a function to create your own experiment or copy the function from the examples folder of the toolkit. Generate data First, we generate the simulated data using the generate_data function of the toolkit. We will use 1000 examples, 120 features in the brain modality and 100 features in the behavioural modality. We set the signal to be sparse with 10% of the features in each modality that are relevant to capture the association across modalities. The noise parameter of the model is set to 1. For further details on the generative model, see Mihalik et al. in review.

For the brain features, we will use the AAL atlas to create 120 regions-level labels. For our behavioural label file, we will simply use indexes for Label and 2 domains as Category . Matlab % Add the AAL2 (https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/tools/aal/) and the BrainNet % Viewer (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/) toolboxes to the path set_path ( 'aal' , 'brainnet' ); % Create AAL labels for simulated sMRI data BrainNet_GenCoord ( which ( 'AAL2.nii' ), 'AAL.txt' ); T = readtable ( 'AAL.txt' ); nROI = size ( T , 1 ); T .

'VariableNames' , { 'Label' 'Category' }); writetable ( T , fullfile ( data_dir , 'LabelsY.csv' )); Analysis First, run set_path to add the necessary paths of the toolkit to your MATLAB path. Matlab %----- Analysis % Set path for analysis set_path ; Project folder Next, we specify the folder to our project. Since we will use the toolkit to generate fake structural MRI data, we do not need to provide input data ( X.mat and Y.mat ). Make sure to specify the correct path. We recommend to use a full path, but a relative path should also work. Matlab % Project folder cfg . dir . project = fullfile ( fileparts ( data_dir )); Machine Now, we configure the CCA/PLS model we would like to use. We set machine.name to rcca for Regularized CCA . To select the best hyperparameter (L2 regularization for RCCA), we will use a generalizability (measured as average out-of-sample corretion on the validation sets) criterion. This is set by machine.param.crit = 'correl' . Matlab % Machine settings cfg . machine . name = 'rcca' ; For more information on the CCA/PLS models and the hyperparameter choices, see here . Framework Next, we set the framework name to holdout and the number of outer data splits to 1 to perform a single holdout approach. The frwork.flag field defines a custom name for this analysis. Make sure to give it a name that will help you organize different analyses you might run on your data. Matlab % Framework settings cfg . frwork . name = 'holdout' ; cfg . frwork . split . nout = 1 ; For further details on the framework choices, see here . Environment Next, we set the computational environment for the toolkit. As our RCCA implementation is computationally efficient, most of the times we can run it locally on our computer. Matlab % Environment settings cfg . env . comp = 'local' ; For further details on the environmental settings, see here . Statistical inference Finally, we need to define how the significance testing is performed. For quicker results, we wet the number of permutations to 100, however, we recommend using at least 1000 permutations in general. Matlab % Statistical inference settings cfg . stat . nperm = 100 ; For further details on the statistical inference, see here . Run analysis To run the analysis, we simply update our cfg structure to add all necessary default values that we did not explicitly define and then run the main function. After the analysis, we clean up all the duplicate and intermediate files to save disc space. Matlab % Update cfg with defaults cfg = cfg_defaults ( cfg ); % Run analysis main ( cfg ); % Clean up analysis files to save disc space cleanup_files ( cfg ); Visualization Now that we have run our first analysis, let's plot some of the results. Before we can do any plotting, we need to make sure that we have called set_path('plot') to add the plotting folder. Then we load the res structure. In general, we advise you to plot your results on a local computer as it is often cumbersome and slow in a cluster environment. If you move your results from a cluster to a local computer, you need update the paths in your cfg*.mat and res*.mat files using update_dir . This should be called once the res structure is loaded either manually or by res_defaults . Matlab %----- Visualization % Set path for plotting and the BrainNet Viewer toolbox set_path ( 'plot' , 'brainnet' ); % Load res res . dir . frwork = cfg . dir . frwork ; res . frwork . level = 1 ; res . gen . selectfile = 'none' ; res = res_defaults ( res , 'load' ); Plot grid search results First, we plot the grid search results of the hyperparameter optimization. As first argument, we need to pass the res structure. Then we specify the data modality as string. The last argument is a varargin to define an optional number of metrics. Each metric will be plotted as a function of the hyperparameter grid and in a separate subplot. In this example, we plot the training (in-sample) and test (out-of-sample) correlations as metrics. Matlab plot_paropt ( res , 1 , { 'trcorrel' , 'correl' }, ... 'gen.figure.Position' , [ 500 600 800 400 ], 'gen.axes.FontSize' , 20 , ... 'gen.axes.XScale' , 'log' , 'gen.axes.YScale' , 'log' ); Plot projections To plot the data projections (or latent variables) that has been learnt by the model, simply run plot_proj . As first argument, we need to pass the res structure. Then, we specify the data modalities as cell array and the level of associative effect. In this example, we plot the projections of X and Y for the first associative effect. We set the fourth input parameter to 'osplit' so that the training and test data of the outer split will be used for the plot. The following argument defines the outer data split we want to use (in this demo, we have only one split). We use the second to last argument to specify the colour-coding of the data using the training and test data as groups ( teid ). Finally, we specify the low-level function that will plot the results. In this case it is plot_proj_2d_group . Please see the documentation of plot_proj for more details. Matlab % Plot data projections plot_proj ( res , { 'X' 'Y' }, res . frwork . level , 'osplit' , 1 , 'training+test' , ... '2d_group' , 'gen.axes.FontSize' , 20 , ...

'proj.scatter.MarkerFaceColor' , [ 0.3 0.3 0.9 ; 0.9 0.3 0.3 ]); Plot weights Plotting model weights heavily depends on the kind of data that has been used in the analysis. In case of our fake structural MRI data, we will plot the weights as nodes on a glass brain. We will use only the top 20 most positive and top 20 most negative weights for the figure. We set this by first sorting the weights by their sign ( roi.weight.sorttype = sign ) then taking the top 20 from both ends ( roi.weight.numtop = 20 ). In case of our fake behavioural data, we will plot the weights as a vertical bar plot, again using only the top 20 most positive and top 20 most negative weights. As first argument, we need to pass the res function, in which we define our custom processing for the weights. We also add the indexes of cerebellum (based on the label file) to the res settings as do not want to include cerebellum weights on the glass brain. Next, we specify the data modality and the type of the modality as strings. In this example, we use region-level brain and behavioural data, so we set these to X and roi for one and Y and behav for the other. The following argument defines the outer data split we want to use. Finally, we specify the low-level function that will plot the results. In this example, it will be plot_weight_brain_node and plot_weight_behav_vert . Please see the documentation of plot_weight for more details.
